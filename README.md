# flask-beginners

My personal repo for building web applications with Flask. Nothing fancy - just teaching myself something new.

Following along the courses provided by Anthony H. located [here](https://prettyprinted.com/) 

Code and tutorials also on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrettyPrinted) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/prettyprintedtutorials) - highly recommended!

## Virtual Environment

This Flask project was built on Windows 10 using a virtual environment using venv. See the following guides:

[Pipenv & Virtual Environments](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) - see Lower level: virtualenv

[Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) - see instructions for Windows

Of course, you can do the same in MacOS or Linux following instructions for those platforms.  Also, pipevn if you prefer.
