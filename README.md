# flask-beginners

My personal repo for building web applications with Flask. Nothing fancy - just teaching myself something new.

Following along the courses provided by Anthony H. located [here](https://prettyprinted.com/) 

Code and tutorials also on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrettyPrinted) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/prettyprintedtutorials) - highly recommended!
